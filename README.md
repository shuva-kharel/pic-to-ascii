## 🌞 Project for

🎉 This project was built with love and curiosity for the [Summer @ Hack Club](https://summer.hackclub.com).
Inspired by retro vibes and command-line art — we made something fun, quirky, and creative for the web.

## 📸 How It Works

1. Upload an image from your device.
2. The app scales it down to manageable resolution.
